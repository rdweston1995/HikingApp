# HikingApp

## Description
Hiking App (name change pending) is a personal project I've been working on. The App will work similar to many other hike searching apps but with the difference of more user reviews for hikes and the ability to search for nearby camping or to save your own campsites.

## Roadmap
* Database creation
* User account creation
* User sign in/logout
* User accounts
* Update hike results display
* Google maps API integration
* Tips/Checklist page
* User saved hikes
* Upload trail reports
* Upload modal/page
* NavBar change similar to that of youtube
* Begin development for mobile
* Fix navbar scaling with different screen sizes
* Create favicon
* Restructure entire site
* Weather API functionality

## Current Ideas
### Explore
* Not quite sure what to do with this page. Will likely change it to be something else

### Plan
* 10 Essentials for hiking/camping. Can also provide links to various stores for people to order or look at the prices of gear
* Might also change this page to be something else.
* Could contain links to more information on safety info
* Will have to look at similar sites to see if/how they present this kind of information

### Tips
* Likely to get lumped into the plan page

### Camping
* One key function of the site that I want to add is the ability to save dispersed campsites that myself/the user comes across and wants to remember.
* Use the google maps API or similar API to have a map on the page that one could use to drop pins on or to search for campgrounds
* For driving directions I would link directly to google maps with the destination already passed in the hyperlink

### Trip reports
* Every hike presented in the hike search results will have user submitted trail reports at the bottom.
* I want to build a page that has all user submitted trail reports with the most recent ones at the top.
* Each report could contain up to maybe a few thousand characters and pictures. 
* Could have default options about trail condtions and crowd size on each report. 
* Might give the option to list how long the hike took. 
* Suggestions on what to look out for on the trail.

### User account page
* Profile picture
* Saved lists of favorite hikes and todo hikes.
* Maybe share campgrounds/dispersed camp locations.
* Show total hikes completed.
